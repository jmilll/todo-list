# To Do List Webapp
A to-do list that that displays projects and their tasks for your own personal to-do list. Robust features (described below) and minimal display to keep your tasks clean and organized.

I also messed around with using Bootstrap framework

Note: Adding a task, to-do, or clicking any buttons will store a tiny amount of data in your local storage as to keep track of your personal tasks without a login. I've included a reset/clear button at the bottom of the projects to clear everything if desired.
